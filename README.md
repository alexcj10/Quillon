## ✨ Features That Make Quillon Stand Out  

### 🧠 Pownin AI (Smart RAG 2.0)
The heart of Quillon is **Pownin**, an Advanced AI powered by a 5-stage retrieval pipeline:
1. **Query Expansion**: Automatically expands messy queries (e.g., "mtg w/ sarah") into strict search terms ("meeting", "Sarah").
2. **Oracle Reranking**: Reads your notes like a human to find relevant content even in "Untitled" or messy files.
3. **Context Chaining**: Creates a dynamic "Knowledge Graph" by following links between notes.
4. **Keyword Sniper**: Instantly boosts exact Title matches for precision retrieval.
5. **Reflection Core**: The AI self-corrects and rewrites answers if they aren't perfect.

### 🏷️ Intelligent Tagging System
Forget manual color codes. Quillon organizes tags automatically:
- **Blue Tags (Folders)**: Tags starting with `file` (e.g., `file-project`) become main folders.
- **Green Tags (Context)**: Tags that live inside a Blue Folder automatically become "Context Tags".
- **Grey Tags**: Standard tags for loose categorization.
*No commands needed. Just tag it, and Quillon sorts it.*

### 📝 Refined Note Editor
- **Distraction-Free**: Full-screen, edge-to-edge editing experience.
- **Responsive**: Perfectly optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
